# Blast-Wave-fit-to-P_t-Spectra
Boltz-mann gibbs Blast-Wave model is a hydrodynamical model widely used in heavy ion as well as in pp collision system to extract freeze-out parameters.
These parameters are extracted by fitting the p_T spectra of particles with the BG-BLAST-WAVE function.
Here ntmax150.root is a smaple root file that contain Au+Au collision data at 39 gev with AMPT model simulation.
The Fit0-10.cc file performed the fit and give you fitting parameters, i.e. Temperature, Radial flow, norm etc.
